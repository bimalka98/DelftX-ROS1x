# Week 3

As discussed before, in our factory environment we will have 2 manipulators (robot arms) and a mobile robot. The mobile robot that we will use is the [TurtleBot](http://www.turtlebot.com/manufacturers/). We will start by introducing this mobile robot.


    What is the TurtleBot?]

    TurtleBot is a mobile robot that can be purchased as a kit or fully assembled. It's a low-cost, personal robot kit with open-source software. With TurtleBot, youâ€™ll be able to build a robot that can drive around your house, see in 3D, and have enough horsepower to create exciting applications.

One of the ROS trainings that we recommend is the ROS-I Academy training. These trainings are designed by the ROS experts of FH Aachen and is part of the ROSIN project. Some of the up-coming trainings in 2020 include:

* ROS-I Academy, Stuttgart (Feb17 - Feb21)
* ROS-I Academy, London (Apr 27 - May 1)
* ROS-I Academy, Stuttgart (Jul 13 - Jul 17)

FH Aachen organizes a ROS yearly Summer School. Everyone who is interested in learning ROS is invited to register! A limited funding for international students could be offered by the DAAD.

Take a look at the upcoming summer school  which will take place on August 10th to 21st at Aachen (Germany).
